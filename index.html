        <h1>Usability Report: Craigslist Website</h1>
    </div>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
            Craigslist is an online platform where users are able to post and browse through ads in a wide range of
            categories, such as jobs, housing, services, items for sale, community, and more. Craigslist started in 1995
            and since then it has expanded to cover 70 countries. Despite its longevity, Craigslist suffers from several
            design flaws affecting usability and user satisfaction, and its appearance being the most pronounced among
            them all. Our research aims to reveal specific areas where the user experience suffers and offer ways to
            mitigate it.

        <h2>Usability audit protocols</h2>

        <p>
            For our usability audit process, we first had participants take a survey of 5 questions about the site's UI,
            ease of use, how the UI affects navigation and whether the UI conveys the site's purpose well. Then, we gave
            participants three tasks to complete, with an easy task and two slightly more difficult tasks to complete.
            We first tasked the user to navigate into the “free stuff” section on their local Craigslist website. This
            first task is meant to test the user's ability to navigate the website and locate specific sections. Then,
            we task the user to search for a used bicycle in the “for sale” section, with the listings filtered by a
            price range of their choice and sorted by the date posted. This task tests the user's ability to use the
            search and filter functions. We finally tasked the user to find an apartment listing in the “apartments/
            housing for rent” section. The apartment needs to be located in Chicago, with washer and drying within the
            unit or within the building, and priced under $1500. This final task tests the user's ability to use the
            search function, applying filters, and navigating through the listings. We took notes on the time each task
            took the participant, as well as specific difficulties they encountered during the process.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        
        <p>
            The results were compiled into a single document, you can access it through this 
            <a href="./files/CRAIGSLIST TASK RESULTS.pdf">link</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            The survey results prior to the tasking process revealed that users were skeptical with the look and feel of
            the website. On average, our participants initially thought that the website seemed difficult to navigate
            and digest the information presented to them. Once we presented them with the different tasks, we noticed
            that a common point of complaint that users have had to do with the homepage. Users that are unfamiliar with
            the website struggled navigating through the various linked sections. Another point of confusion was sorting
            through the listings. One of the tasks asked the user to sort their results by the date they are posted,
            however multiple participants encountered failed to find the drop-down menu to do so. Moreover, filtering
            through the results from their search also posed as a challenge for our participants due to the long list of
            options that they need to sieve through to find the appropriate filter for the task. Though, the post-task
            survey results showed an overall change in their perception of the website. Our participants on average were
            neutral on the content presentation of the website and its ease of navigation. This leads us to believe that
            there are several ways we can improve the overall experience of users.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>

        <p>
            Utilizing the information we gathered from conducting the usability audit, we have identified the following
            items as problems with Craigslist's user interface:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Refurbishing the homepage:</strong>
                <p>
                    The current design of Craigslist's is already subject to improvements. As it is, many users think
                    that the website looks dated and cluttered, especially for newer users. This can be attributed to
                    the fact that the different sections appear as hyperlinks with their default color, as well as the
                    sheer number of links being displayed all at once. A clearer visual hierarchy is needed in order to
                    give the website its proper presentation. One method to achieve this is to give the headers a more
                    distinct look than the body text by using a darker shade of the color. This will also diversify the
                    current monochrome color palette of the website whilst sticking with the well-known theme users are
                    accustomed to.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are also redundancies on the right sidebar that can be removed to declutter the homepage.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="./illustrations/fig1.png"
                        alt="Illustration of Craiglist's homepage">
                    <figcaption>
                        Figure 1: Content of the sidebar is also linked in the footer

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The empty space provided by removing the redundancies can be used to improve the search bar
                    presentation, as well as easing users into their targeted sections. From our research, inexperienced
                    users typically opt to navigate through the search bar, and adding a dropdown menu with popular
                    sections below it can guide them to finding the listing of the targeted categories.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="./illustrations/fig2.png"
                        alt="Illustration of the improvements to the left sidebar">
                    <figcaption>
                        Figure 2: Left sidebar decluttered with added functionality to search by category
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The header of the homepage is problematic as well, since its purpose is to inform the user of their
                    currently selected location for browsing. At a glance, users may not realize that the text is
                    actually a link that allows them to change their location due to the coloring.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="./illustrations/fig3.png"
                        alt="Illustration highlighting Craigslist's header">

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <figure>
                    <img src="./illustrations/fig4.png"
                        alt="Illustration of a search location window">

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    We can solve this issue by adding a pretext “current location:” followed by their currently selected
                    location. This also eliminates the use of the right sidebar, since the list of locations is all
                    contained within the window of the location link, further decluttering the homepage.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="./illustrations/fig5.png"

            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Refurbishing the results page:</strong>
                <p>
                    Similar to the homepage, the design of Craigslist's result page is subject to improvement. The
                    visual hierarchy of the page lacks organization to its structure. Additionally, the results page
                    contains redundant elements to define your search result.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="./illustrations/fig6.png"
                        alt="Illustration of Craigslist's search page and filter options">
                    <figcaption>
                        Figure 6: Results page of the jewelry section on Craigslist
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The contents of the page that will be discussed are boxed/underlined and labeled by letter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As shown in figure 6, the results page contains two separate sections that have to do with location.
                    The first section is at A, the top of the page, where Chicago and All Chicago are selected, and can
                    be changed due to the drop-down menu. The second section is at C, where the user can select a mile
                    radius from a certain location. While it is important to specify the location, as well as the
                    precise location of your search, it can be confusing to the user if they want to refine their
                    search. A solution to this would be to make the information listed in items A as simple text, so it
                    is clear to the user that they should refine their search at C.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are redundant elements on the page to create a more refined search. In item B, you are able to
                    filter results by price, condition, and sold by. In item D, you are able to filter your result by
                    price. In item F, you are able to use the drop-down menu to filter your result by the condition of
                    the item. The elements in items D and F serve the same purpose as the elements in item B. There are
                    two potential solutions to this problem. The first solution would be to remove the elements in item
                    B and keep the elements in items D and F. The second solution would be to remove the elements in
                    items D and F, keeping the elements in item B.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, the element in item E is irrelevant to the sidebar if it is not related to vehicles.
                    The element in item E asks for the user to type in the desired make and model for their search. In
                    the context of any search besides vehicles, this element in the sidebar is useless and irrelevant.
                    The solution to this problem would be to remove the element E altogether. If it is necessary to the
                    vehicles section of the search result, then it should exclusively belong to the vehicle section of
                    the website.

            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Make filter UI act uniformly:</strong>
                <p>
                    For our third task, users had to search for apartments in a certain price range and with the
                    "Washer/dryer in unit" filter enabled. When sorting by cost, the site automatically refreshes
                    results. However, checking the "Washer/dryer in unit" filter does not immediately refresh results.
                    Instead, you have to also select an apply button. The way it is implemented resulted in confusion
                    for our usability audit's participants, because the user must scroll to the end of the sidebar to
                    see the apply button.
                </p>

                <figure>

            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Adding an internal messaging/chat platform:</strong>
                <p>
                    Craigslist has all the basic components of what makes a buying/selling platform functional, but it
                    lacks ease of communication between buyers and sellers. On any posting within Craigslist, there's a
                    drop-down option to "reply" as an email or by phone number, given the seller is comfortable sharing
                    that sensitive information. However, the option of replying by email is, for the most part, severely
                    outdated.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="./illustrations/fig8.png"
                        alt="Illustration of an apartment listing on Craigslist">

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    This is a typical post you could find in the apartments/housing listing section. A typical generic
                    format of Craiglist. Within the "reply" button, you can see it drops down to email, call or text:
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="./illustrations/fig9.png"
                        alt="Illustration of communication window under reply button">

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    As displayed in the email drop down feature, these options in replying seem outdated. Although these
                    email platforms and replying options are still completely viable, it takes you out of Craigslist
                    onto the email website, has you login, compose a new email, etc. On top of that, the email given is
                    an encrypted Craigslist email assigned to hide the seller's personal email by giving a randomized
                    combination of letters and numbers. This encryption also works for the buyer when they email the
                    seller. There are several steps related to the email function.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="./illustrations/fig10.png"

                    <figcaption>Figure 10: Call/Text Phone Number Dropdown</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The call and text options are also present, but usually only display their number. This is up to the
                    seller whether they want their number out in the public or not. Plus, having your number out means
                    anyone who comes across the post can view your phone number, even if they were interested in the
                    post or not. A great way to remove this potential privacy concern is to add an internal messaging
                    platform, so users do not have to post their number for communication. Should any genuine interested
                    buyer exchange a conversation on a potential internal messaging platform, the seller could then
                    share their number if need be.
                </p>

                </figure>

                <p>
                    A Q&A section on the posting could be helpful as well. The seller chooses which question to ask if
                    legitimate, and will be open to the public to see, if there was anything that was missed in the
                    description of the post.

                </figure>

                <p>
                    Adding an Inbox or Messages section next to the top right section near "post" and "account" and
                    removing the "reply" dropdown entirely would be ideal. Taking the messages section into a different
                    page should be easier than clicking on reply and going out on different email platforms for contact.
                </p>

        </ol>
        
        <p>
            By addressing these issues and implementing suggested solutions such as improving visual hierarchy and decluttering,
            simplifying filtering options, ensuring uniform behavior in applying filters, and introducing to a internal
            messaging system, Craigslist can greatly enhance its user interface and user experience, making it more
            intuitive and efficient for all users.
